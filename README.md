Just a simple spelling bee game :) Here I would talk about how to run in your local machine and for deployment. All the coding was done on Linux (Fedora btw) so it might be different for other OS/distributions.

Hello there explorer :). This over here is just for google tts. It save the bytes generated into an s3 bucket so that my credits don't get cooked. This is the branch I used at the end of the day for deployment. Not to say the other's aren't bad, but google's tts is just superior (according to my brother).
