# Spelling Bee

Just a simple spelling bee game :) Here I would talk about how to run in your local machine and for deployment. All the coding was done on Linux (Fedora btw) so it might be different for other OS/distributions.




## Random Rambling
Hello there :). This is the second model I tried after the Piper TTS. I used Kokoro's TTS model, but since it was slower to infrence than the previous I ended up generating the audio first and then storing them in an s3 bucket. The generation took hours, like a whole day, and I also found out that AWS's online upload from the web is omega ass. In the end I still switch this one out for google's TTS, so sad.
